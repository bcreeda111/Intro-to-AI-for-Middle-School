A cheerful classroom full of curious 6th graders learning how to create their first short video. this video should look like pixar, and each character should be pixar characters.  

The scene shows students working together in small groups, using laptops and tablets, storyboarding ideas with colorful markers on whiteboards, and laughing as they record short video clips. 

A friendly teacher moves around the room, encouraging creativity. The vibe is energetic and fun, with posters on the walls about storytelling, animation, and editing tips. 
The classroom is bright and modern, filled with sunlight and positive energy.
