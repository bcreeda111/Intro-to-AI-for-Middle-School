A cheerful classroom full of curious 5th, 6th, and 7th graders learning how to create their first short video. The scene shows students working together in small groups, using laptops and tablets, storyboarding ideas with colorful markers on whiteboards, and laughing as they record short video clips. A friendly teacher moves around the room, encouraging creativity. The vibe is energetic and fun, with posters on the walls about storytelling, animation, and editing tips. The classroom is bright and modern, filled with sunlight and positive energy. The animation style should be vibrant, youthful, and expressiveâ€”like an educational Pixar short.
