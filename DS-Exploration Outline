I am teaching a class to a group of super smart 5th, 6th and 7th grader about AI.  Below is the outline of the class.  There's a problem though, I forgot to prepare!  Help!

I need to create a presentation fast that introduces me to the class and gives them a quick outline of what we are going to learn.  Take my profile and produce a 3 slide outline: https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandoncreedanderson/

Intro to AI: Build a Working App

Curious about AI? Let’s explore how artificial intelligence can help us create real software without needing any coding experience! We’ll start by learning the basics of AI and how to give it the right instructions. Then, as a team, we’ll design and build a working app using the latest AI-powered tools. By the end, we’ll have a functioning prototype—made with AI and our own creativity!


And here is an outline for the exploration. 

Intro to AI and Prompting

• What is AI? How does it help us build apps?

• Practice with ChatGPT: crafting good prompts



Brainstorm & Plan Our App

• Discussing different types of apps we could build

• Voting on an idea as a group

• Using ChatGPT to outline features and structure

• Sketching out a simple plan for our app



Start Building with AI

• Setting up our app using Lovable.dev

• Using AI to generate code and content



Finish & Share Our App

• Refining and adding final touches

• Show and tell: demonstrating our finished app!
