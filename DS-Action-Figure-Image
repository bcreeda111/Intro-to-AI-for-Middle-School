Create a realistic, modern action figure of 

XXXX, 

sealed in its original packaging. The action figure should look like a toy with clearly visible plastic joints, slightly exaggerated 
proportions like classic action figures, and realistic facial features resembling the picture. 
The packaging design should be bold and colourful, with clear text and fun descriptions that reflect his personality, profession, and skills 

(XXXX, XXXX, XXXX). 

Include 2 or 3 small accessories that match his daily work or hobbies (e.g., X, X, X). 

Make sure the packaging includes name, a catchy title, age rating, and playful copywriting on the box that reflects the person. The entire image should look like a product.
