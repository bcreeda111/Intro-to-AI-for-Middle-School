"Hi, I’m totally just a regular 6th grader and not a robot. I loooove veggies—especially brussels sprouts. Mmm… bitter! 

My favorite hobby? Cleaning my room. Nothing beats organizing socks by color! 

And homework? Yes please, give me extra! I definitely don’t want to play video games or eat candy. Nope. Not at all."
