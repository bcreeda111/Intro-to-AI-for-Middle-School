Step 1: Divergent Thinking
Your objective is to help me solve this problem:
{{problem}}
Here is more background information and constraints:
{{context}}
Your task is to generate 3 distinctly innovative solutions to my problem. Each solution should be very different. Consider:
Different perspectives or mental models.
Trade-offs between efficiency, cost, complexity, and risk.
Any relevant principles, frameworks, or unconventional strategies that could lead to breakthrough insights.

Step 2: Analysis
For each proposed solution, please provide:
Strengths & Benefits
Weaknesses & Risks
Effort & Resource Demand
Possible Roadblocks & Failure Points
Potential Scenarios
Success Probability Estimate

Step 3: Selection
Now that we have evaluated each option, let’s determine the best course of action.
Rank the options from most promising to least promising, based on feasibility, impact, and risk-reward balance.
Provide a detailed justification for the ranking, explaining how each option aligns (or conflicts) with my goals and constraints.
Offer recommendations for refinement – Could any option be combined, adjusted, or made more viable with certain modifications?
Suggest next steps I should take.
