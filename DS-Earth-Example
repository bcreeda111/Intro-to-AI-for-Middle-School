"Create a React Three Fiber application that visualizes an interactive, photorealistic 3D globe with the following key features:

Technical Requirements:

Use React Three Fiber and Three.js for 3D rendering
Implement a detailed Earth sphere with:
Realistic landmass textures
Partially transparent cloud layer
Subtle atmospheric glow
Implement region detection and highlighting on hover
Add orbital controls for user interaction
Create a background of randomly distributed stars
Handle texture loading with robust error management
Functional Features:

Globe rotation toggle (start/pause)
Hover over different geographic regions to display region information
Smooth, interactive 3D rendering
Responsive design that works across different screen sizes
Specific Implementation Details:

Use high-resolution textures for earth, clouds, normal, and specular maps
Implement a Stars component with randomly positioned points
Use @react-three/drei for orbit controls
Create loading and error states for texture rendering
Use a dark space-themed background
Implement lat/long conversion for region detection
UI/UX Considerations:

Provide clear visual feedback during texture loading
Create a minimalist, space-themed interface
Ensure smooth camera controls and rotation
Display region information in an overlay when hovering over different areas
Performance and Optimization:

Efficient texture loading with fallback mechanisms
Optimize rendering performance
Implement smooth animation and interaction
Technology Stack:

React
React Three Fiber
Three.js
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS for styling
