Create a colorful, engaging slide presentation for a 4-day classroom workshop called “Intro to AI – Building an App.” The students are 6th graders, and the presentation should be simple, fun, and visually rich with cartoon or Pixar-style illustrations. Break the presentation into four themed days:

**Day 1: Intro & AI Basics**
- Introductions
- Instructor background
- Goals: action figures, voice clones, app building
- What is AI? (Text, Image, Video, Voice)
- Good prompting (Goal, Role, Context, Specific)
- Homework: bring 1–2 app ideas

**Day 2: Creative Exploration**
- Action figure demos
- Voice cloning activity
- Superhero video
- Turn objects into 3D
- Brainstorm and vote on app ideas
- Planning: problem, audience, solution

**Day 3: Build Your App**
- Make a song
- Use ChatGPT and Lovable.dev to build
- Coding begins

**Day 4: Launch Day**
- Students present their apps
- Class celebration

Use fun fonts, bold headings, and one big idea per slide. Include spots for student interaction (e.g., "Raise your hand if...").
