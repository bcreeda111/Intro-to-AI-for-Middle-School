"I want to create an immersive 3D globe visualization that accurately represents the Earth. My goals are:

Develop a React Three Fiber component for a photorealistic Earth model with the following specifications:

High-quality textures showing landmasses, water, and cloud layers
Realistic lighting that highlights surface details
Smooth rotation and interactive features
Ability to detect and highlight geographic regions
Technical Requirements:

Use React Three Fiber and Three.js for 3D rendering
Implement texture loading with error handling
Create an interactive experience with hover and pointer move events
Add orbital controls for user interaction
Implement region detection based on sphere coordinates
Design Considerations:

Ensure the globe has a dark space background
Use a balanced color palette that makes landmasses and water clearly distinguishable
Add subtle atmospheric glow
Implement smooth cloud layer with partial transparency
Adjust camera field of view for optimal visual appeal
Additional Features:

Toggle rotation on/off
Highlight different regions when hovering over the globe
Provide loading and error states for texture rendering
Bonus points for using placeholder images from Unsplash to create realistic textures and lighting effects."
