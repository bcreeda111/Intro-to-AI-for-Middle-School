Create a short 3D animation in a playful toy-commercial style. Start with a close-up of the Bob 'The Great' action figure in its sealed packaging. 
A hand reaches into the frame, peels open the plastic, and lifts the figure out. The camera shifts as the action figure blinks, stretches, and walks off confidently, carrying its X. 
Add toy-box lighting throughout.
