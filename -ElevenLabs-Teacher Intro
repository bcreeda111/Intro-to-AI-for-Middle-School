"Alright, class — welcome to 'AI and Building an App' — or as I like to call it, 'How to Train Your Robot to Do Your Homework… Kind Of.'

I’m Mr. Brandon — part teacher, part tech nerd, part snack enthusiast — and this class is where we turn wild ideas into real apps with the help of AI. By the end, you’ll have your very own working app. No, seriously. It won’t do your chores (yet), but it might help you become the next tech genius your parents brag about at dinner parties.

Let’s dive in, make some magic, and try not to break the internet!"
